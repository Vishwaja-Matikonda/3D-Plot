# 3D-Plot


3D Scatter and Line Plots
3D plotting in Matplotlib starts by enabling the utility toolkit. We can enable this toolkit by importing the mplot3d library, which comes with your standard Matplotlib installation via pip.
Once this sub-module is imported, 3D plots can be created by passing the keyword projection="3d" to any of the regular axes creation functions in Matplotlib

Surface Plots
Surface plots can be great for visualising the relationships among 3 variables across the entire 3D landscape. They give a full structure and view as to how the value of each variable changes across the axes of the 2 others.

3D Bar Plots
Bar plots are used quite frequently in data visualisation projects since theyâ€™re able to convey information, usually some type of comparison, in a simple and intuitive way. The beauty of 3D bar plots is that they maintain the simplicity of 2D bar plots while extending their capacity to represent comparative information.
